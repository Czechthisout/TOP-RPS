# Rock, Paper, Scissors

An interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game with buttery smooth animations and responsive design.

## Key Learnings

### 1. Responsive Design and Advanced CSS Keyframe Animations
Throughout the development of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I worked on creating a responsive design for users. CSS keyframe animations, inspired by [Josh Comeau's blog post](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/keyframe-animations/), were central to this effort. This involved creating smooth and visually appealing animations such as `floatUp`, `shake`, and `grow-and-shrink` to enhance the user experience and make the game more engaging.

### 2. Event Handling and DOM Manipulation
Building on the first lesson from[WesBos's JavaScript30 program](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), I worked on incorporating event handling to add a UI in the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This involved working with the DOM to update the user interface dynamically based on user interactions, manipulating HTML elements, and adding and removing classes. 

### 3. Tooltips (brought up from *Future Improvements* April 11th, 2023)
I integrated [TippyJS](https://github.com/atomiks/tippyjs), a customizable tooltip library, to add enjoyable player education on top of the game buttons. It won't help playing the bot, but users of my RPS tool will soon be seen on ESPN Top 10 replays. I leveraged the quick-and-easy CDN links and got comfortable reading technical documentation for API calls. I won't tell you about the hours of reading I spent trying to make the tooltips from scratch with vanilla Javascript and CSS...
